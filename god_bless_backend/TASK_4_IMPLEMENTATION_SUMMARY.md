### Requirement 1.2 ✅
**Proxy Strategy Compliance:**
- Respects user's chosen rotation strategy (round_robin, random, least_used, best_performance)
- Proper rotation through available healthy proxies
- Graceful handling when no proxies are available

### Requirement 1.3 ✅
**Proxy Failure Handling:**
- Automatic proxy health marking and rotation on failure
- Continues operation without proxy when none available
- Comprehensive logging and error tracking

**Enhanced SMTP Rotation:**
- Intelligent SMTP rotation based on server health and performance
- Automatic failover when servers become unavailable
- Performance-based server selection algorithms

### Requirement 2.2 ✅
**SMTP Health Tracking:**
- Real-time health monitoring and failure detection
- Campaign pause when all SMTP servers are unhealthy
- Success/failure counter updates for performance monitoring

### Requirement 3.1 ✅
**Configurable Delivery Timing:**
- Custom delivery delays (minimum and maximum seconds)
- Campaign-specific override of global settings
- Random delay generation with optional seed support

### Requirement 3.2 ✅
**Delay Application:**
- Random delays between configured minimum and maximum values
- Integration with carrier-specific rate limits
- Performance impact tracking and optimization

### Requirement 3.3 ✅
**Delivery Time Estimation:**
- Estimated completion time calculation based on current settings
- Real-time progress updates with timing information
- Performance metrics for optimization
