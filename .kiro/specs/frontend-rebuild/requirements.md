# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification focuses on fixing critical issues in the existing God Bless platform frontend to ensure all implemented features work properly. The platform is largely complete with modern React components, Django backend integration, and comprehensive functionality. The goal is to resolve specific React errors (useState issues), authentication problems, and ensure seamless integration between the existing frontend and backend systems.
