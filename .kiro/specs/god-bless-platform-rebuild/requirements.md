# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The God Bless Platform is a comprehensive phone number management and validation system that requires a complete frontend rebuild. The current frontend (god_bless_frontend) has UI errors and implementation issues that affect user experience. This project will create a new React-based frontend called "god_bless_platform" that properly connects to the existing Django backend while providing a clean, modern, and error-free user interface.

The platform serves businesses and organizations that need to manage large volumes of phone numbers, validate contact information, and send SMS communications at scale. The new frontend will implement all core features with improved reliability, better user experience, and proper integration with backend services including WebSockets, Celery tasks, and Redis.

7. WHEN validation tasks run THEN the system SHALL show progress and results in real-time
8. IF generation or validation fails THEN the system SHALL display detailed error information

### Requirement 5: Data Export and Filtering

**User Story:** As a user, I want to download validated phone numbers in multiple formats with filtering options, so that I can export data according to my specific needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the download section THEN the system SHALL display available phone numbers with filtering options
2. WHEN a user applies filters THEN the system SHALL filter numbers by carrier, validation status, and other relevant fields
3. WHEN a user selects export format THEN the system SHALL provide options for CSV, TXT, JSON, and DOC formats
4. WHEN a user initiates download THEN the system SHALL generate the file with selected filters applied
5. WHEN file generation is complete THEN the system SHALL provide download link or auto-download
6. WHEN large exports are processed THEN the system SHALL show progress via background task monitoring
7. IF export fails THEN the system SHALL display error message with retry option

### Requirement 6: SMS Campaign Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to send single and bulk SMS messages with SMTP and proxy rotation, so that I can manage SMS campaigns efficiently and reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses SMS campaigns THEN the system SHALL provide options for single and bulk messaging
2. WHEN a user creates a campaign THEN the system SHALL allow message composition and recipient selection
3. WHEN bulk SMS is initiated THEN the system SHALL process messages via background tasks with progress tracking

### Requirement 7: External Number Import and SMS
