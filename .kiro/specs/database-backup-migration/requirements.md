# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature provides database backup and migration capabilities for the God Bless America platform, specifically focusing on exporting critical data like validator carrier information from SQLite to JSON format for backup purposes and migration to other database systems like PostgreSQL.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Database Data Export

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to export database tables to JSON format, so that I can create backups and migrate data between different database systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator runs the export command THEN the system SHALL export specified database tables to JSON format
2. WHEN exporting validator carrier data THEN the system SHALL include all fields and relationships
3. WHEN export is complete THEN the system SHALL save the JSON file with timestamp and table name
4. WHEN export encounters errors THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information and continue with other tables
5. IF export fails completely THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and rollback any partial exports

### Requirement 2: Selective Table Export

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to specify which tables to export, so that I can create targeted backups for specific data sets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running export command THEN the system SHALL accept table name parameters
2. WHEN no tables are specified THEN the system SHALL export all tables by default
3. WHEN invalid table names are provided THEN the system SHALL display available table names and exit gracefully
4. WHEN exporting multiple tables THEN the system SHALL create separate JSON files for each table
5. WHEN table has foreign key relationships THEN the system SHALL preserve relationship data in the export

### Requirement 3: Data Import from JSON

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to import JSON data into database tables, so that I can restore backups or migrate data from other systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN administrator runs import command THEN the system SHALL validate JSON format before importing
2. WHEN JSON structure matches table schema THEN the system SHALL import all records
3. WHEN importing data with foreign keys THEN the system SHALL maintain referential integrity
4. WHEN duplicate records exist THEN the system SHALL provide options to skip, update, or fail
5. IF import fails THEN the system SHALL rollback all changes and preserve original data
6. WHEN import is successful THEN the system SHALL log the number of records imported per table

### Requirement 4: Migration Compatibility

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want exported data to be compatible with different database systems, so that I can migrate from SQLite to PostgreSQL or other databases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL use database-agnostic JSON format
2. WHEN exporting datetime fields THEN the system SHALL use ISO 8601 format
3. WHEN exporting boolean fields THEN the system SHALL use consistent true/false values
4. WHEN exporting null values THEN the system SHALL preserve null state in JSON
5. WHEN exporting binary data THEN the system SHALL encode as base64 strings
6. WHEN creating export THEN the system SHALL include schema information for target database compatibility

### Requirement 5: Backup Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to manage backup files with proper naming and organization, so that I can easily identify and restore specific backups.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating backup THEN the system SHALL use timestamp-based file naming
2. WHEN backup is created THEN the system SHALL include database version and table schema information
3. WHEN multiple backups exist THEN the system SHALL provide commands to list available backups
4. WHEN backup files are large THEN the system SHALL provide compression options
5. WHEN backup is corrupted THEN the system SHALL detect and report corruption during validation
