# Sidebar Navigation Update - New Dashboard Links Added

## Overview
Added navigation links to the new stable dashboard (`/dashboard-new`) in both sidebar components to provide easy access from anywhere in the application.

## Changes Made

### 1. ProjectSidebar Component
**File**: `src/components/ProjectSidebar/index.tsx`

Added "Platform Dashboard" link in the PROJECT NAVIGATION section:
```typescript
{/* <!-- Platform Dashboard --> */}
<li>
  <NavLink
    to="/dashboard-new"
    className={({ isActive }) =>
      `group relative flex items-center gap-2.5 rounded-sm py-2 px-4 font-medium ${
        isActive
          ? 'bg-white text-black dark:bg-meta-4 dark:text-white'
          : 'text-bodydark1 hover:bg-white hover:text-black dark:hover:bg-meta-4'
      } duration-300 ease-in-out`
    }
  >
    <svg>...</svg>
    🌐 Platform Dashboard
  </NavLink>
</li>
```

**Position**: Added after "← All Projects" link, before "Dashboard" (project-specific)

### 2. Main Sidebar Component
**File**: `src/components/Sidebar/index.tsx`

Added "New Dashboard" link in the main MENU section:
```typescript
{/* <!-- Menu Item New Dashboard --> */}
<li>
  <NavLink
    to="/dashboard-new"
    className={({ isActive }) =>
      `group relative flex items-center gap-2.5 rounded-sm py-2 px-4 font-medium ${
        isActive
          ? 'bg-white text-black dark:bg-meta-4 dark:text-white'
          : 'text-bodydark1 hover:bg-white hover:text-black dark:hover:bg-meta-4'
      } duration-300 ease-in-out `
    }
  >
    <svg>...</svg>
    🚀 New Dashboard
  </NavLink>
</li>
```

**Position**: Added after "Dashboard" link, before "All Numbers"

## User Experience

### ✅ **Easy Access**
- Users can access the stable new dashboard from both navigation contexts
- Clear visual distinction with emojis (🌐 and 🚀)
- Consistent styling with existing navigation items

### ✅ **Context-Aware**
- **ProjectSidebar**: "Platform Dashboard" - emphasizes it's the main platform overview
- **Main Sidebar**: "New Dashboard" - indicates it's the improved version

### ✅ **Active State Handling**
- Both links properly highlight when active
- Same hover and focus states as other navigation items
- Consistent with existing navigation patterns

## Testing

### 1. **ProjectSidebar Access**
- Navigate to any project page (e.g., `/project/123`)
- Look for "🌐 Platform Dashboard" in the sidebar
- Click to navigate to `/dashboard-new`

### 2. **Main Sidebar Access**
- Navigate to any regular page (e.g., `/all-numbers`)
- Look for "🚀 New Dashboard" in the sidebar
- Click to navigate to `/dashboard-new`

### 3. **Active State Testing**
- Navigate to `/dashboard-new`
- Verify the link is highlighted in the appropriate sidebar
- Check that styling matches other active navigation items

## Benefits

### 🎯 **Improved Discoverability**
- Users can easily find the stable dashboard from any page
- Clear labeling distinguishes it from the original dashboard

### 🎯 **Consistent Navigation**
- Follows existing navigation patterns
- Same styling and behavior as other menu items

### 🎯 **Better User Flow**
- Quick access to platform overview from project contexts
- Easy switching between different dashboard views

### 🎯 **Future-Ready**
- When the new dashboard becomes the primary one, easy to update links
- Clear separation between old and new versions during transition

## Next Steps

### 1. **Test Navigation**
- Verify links work from both sidebar contexts
- Check active states and styling
- Test on different screen sizes

### 2. **User Feedback**
- Gather feedback on the new dashboard accessibility
- Monitor usage patterns between old and new dashboards

### 3. **Future Migration**
Once the new dashboard is confirmed stable:
- Update main dashboard link to point to `/dashboard-new`
- Remove or rename the old dashboard links
- Update any hardcoded navigation references

The new dashboard is now easily accessible from both navigation contexts, providing users with quick access to the stable platform overview regardless of where they are in the application.
