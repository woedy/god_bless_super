# Modern Dashboard Navigation Enhancement

## Overview
Added easy navigation to the Modern Dashboard from project-related pages to improve user experience and accessibility.

## Changes Made

### 1. All Projects Page (`/all-projects`)
**File**: `god_bless_frontend/src/pages/Projects/AllProjects.tsx`

**Added**:
- Modern Dashboard navigation button in the header area
- Clean header section with "Project Management" title
- Dashboard icon using `FiBarChart` from react-icons
- Hover effects and consistent styling

**Features**:
- Prominent "Modern Dashboard" button with chart icon
- Located at the top right of the page for easy access
- Consistent with the app's design language
- Smooth navigation to `/dashboard` route

### 2. Add Project Page (`/add-project`)
**File**: `god_bless_frontend/src/pages/Projects/AddProject.tsx`

**Added**:
- Similar Modern Dashboard navigation button
- Header section with "Create New Project" title
- Same styling and functionality as All Projects page

### 3. Safe Constants Usage
**Updated both files to use safe localStorage access functions**:
- `getUserID()` instead of `userID`
- `getUserToken()` instead of `userToken`
- `getUsername()` instead of `username`

## UI/UX Improvements

### Visual Design
```tsx
<div className="mb-6 flex justify-between items-center">
  <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-black dark:text-white">
    Project Management
  </h2>
  <button
    onClick={() => navigate('/dashboard')}
    className="flex items-center gap-2 rounded bg-primary px-4 py-2 text-white hover:bg-opacity-90 transition-all"
  >
    <FiBarChart className="w-5 h-5" />
    Modern Dashboard
  </button>
</div>
```
