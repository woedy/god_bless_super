# React Hook and Component Initialization Fixes

## Summary of Issues Fixed

This document summarizes the React hook and component initialization issues that were identified and resolved.

## 1. Constants File - localStorage Access Issues

**Problem**: The `constants.tsx` file was accessing `localStorage` at the module level, which can cause "Cannot read properties of null" errors during SSR or initial render.

**Fix**: 
- Replaced direct `localStorage` access with safe functions that check for browser environment
- Added TypeScript types to the `truncateText` function
- Created safe accessor functions: `getUserToken()`, `getUserID()`, `getUserEmail()`, etc.

**Files Modified**:
- `src/constants.tsx`

## 2. ThemeProvider Context Issues

**Problem**: The ThemeProvider was not handling potential SSR issues and DOM access errors.

**Fix**:
- Added safe initialization checks for `window` object
- Wrapped localStorage and matchMedia access in try-catch blocks
- Added proper error handling for DOM manipulation

**Files Modified**:
- `src/contexts/ThemeContext.tsx`

## 3. App Component Hook Order Issues

**Problem**: The App component lacked proper error handling and could have hook order violations.

**Fix**:
- Ensured hooks are always called at the top level
- Added error state management
- Improved loading state handling
- Added proper cleanup for timers

**Files Modified**:
- `src/App.tsx`

## 4. Main Entry Point Error Handling

**Problem**: The main.tsx file lacked proper error handling for React root creation.

**Fix**:
- Added checks for root element existence
- Wrapped React root creation in try-catch
- Added fallback error display for critical failures

**Files Modified**:
- `src/main.tsx`

## 5. Header Component Props Issues

**Problem**: Header component had loose prop typing that could cause issues.

**Fix**:
- Added proper TypeScript interface for props
- Fixed prop usage throughout the component
- Updated to use safe localStorage access functions

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/Header/index.tsx`

## 6. DefaultLayout State Management

**Problem**: DefaultLayout was not properly managing sidebar state.

**Fix**:
- Added proper useState for sidebar management
- Added safe pathname access
- Properly passed state to child components

**Files Modified**:
- `src/layout/DefaultLayout.tsx`

## 7. Sidebar Component useEffect Issues

**Problem**: Sidebar component had useEffect hooks without proper dependency arrays.

**Fix**:
- Added proper dependency arrays to all useEffect hooks
- Added safe localStorage access
- Improved error handling for DOM manipulation

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/Sidebar/index.tsx`

## 8. DarkModeSwitcher Context Access

**Problem**: DarkModeSwitcher could fail if ThemeContext was not available.

**Fix**:
- Added proper fallback values for context access
- Improved error handling for missing context

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/Header/DarkModeSwitcher.tsx`

## 9. DropdownUser Component localStorage Issues

**Problem**: DropdownUser was using unsafe localStorage constants.

**Fix**:
- Updated to use safe accessor functions
- Added fallback values for missing user data
- Improved image fallback handling

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/Header/DropdownUser.tsx`

## 10. Legacy Component Updates

**Problem**: Several legacy components were still using unsafe localStorage access.

**Fix**:
- Updated ValidateNumber component to use safe functions
- Updated TaskHistoryPage to use safe functions
- Added proper imports for safe accessor functions

**Files Modified**:
- `src/pages/Validation/ValidateNumber.tsx`
- `src/pages/TaskHistory/TaskHistoryPage.tsx`

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. Safe localStorage Access
```typescript
// Before (unsafe)
export const userToken = localStorage.getItem('token');

// After (safe)
export const getUserToken = (): string | null => {
  if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
    return localStorage.getItem('token');
  }
  return null;
};
```

### 2. Proper Hook Order
```typescript
// Before (potential issues)
function App() {
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState<boolean>(true);
  // ... other code that might conditionally call hooks

// After (safe)
function App() {
  // Always call hooks at the top level
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState<boolean>(true);
  const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null);
  // ... rest of hooks
```

### 3. Error Boundaries and Fallbacks
```typescript
// Added proper error handling throughout
if (error) {
  return <ErrorFallback error={error} />;
}

if (loading) {
  return <Loader />;
}
```

### 4. Context Safety
```typescript
// Before (could throw)
const { theme, toggleTheme } = useTheme();

// After (safe with fallbacks)
const themeContext = useContext(ThemeContext);
const theme = themeContext?.theme || 'light';
const toggleTheme = themeContext?.toggleTheme || (() => {
  console.warn('Theme toggle not available');
});
```

## Testing

A test component (`HookTest.tsx`) was created to verify that all hooks are working properly:
- useState hook functionality
- useEffect hook functionality  
- useContext hook functionality
- Proper hook order and conditional rendering

## Expected Results

After these fixes, the application should:
1. ✅ No longer throw "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'useState')" errors
2. ✅ Properly handle SSR and initial render scenarios
3. ✅ Have consistent hook order across all components
4. ✅ Gracefully handle missing localStorage data
5. ✅ Properly wrap all components with ThemeProvider context
6. ✅ Handle component mounting issues without crashes
7. ✅ Provide better error messages and fallback states

## Verification Steps

1. Start the development server
2. Check browser console for any React hook errors
3. Test theme switching functionality
4. Test authentication flow
5. Verify all components render without errors
6. Test localStorage-dependent features
