# Docker Services Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. PostgreSQL Container Not Starting
**Problem**: The PostgreSQL container was in "Created" status but not running due to volume mounting issues.

**Solution**: Changed from bind mount (`./data/db`) to named volume (`postgres_data`) which is more reliable across different systems.

### 2. Celery Beat Container Not Starting
**Problem**: Celery Beat container was in "Created" status.

**Solution**: Added `restart: always` policy to ensure the container starts automatically.

### 3. Services Not Auto-Starting
**Problem**: Services were created but not starting automatically on docker-compose up.

**Solution**: Added `restart: always` to all service definitions in docker-compose.yml.

## Changes Made

### docker-compose.yml Updates
1. Changed PostgreSQL volume from bind mount to named volume
2. Added `restart: always` to all services:
   - redis
   - db (PostgreSQL)
   - god_bless_app (Django)
   - god_bless_frontend
   - celery
   - celery-beat
3. Added `postgres_data` to volumes section
4. Added Redis as a dependency for Django app

### New Helper Scripts Created

1. **stop-local.cmd** - Stops all Docker services
2. **view-logs.cmd** - Interactive script to view logs from any service
3. **check-status.cmd** - Checks the status and health of all services

## Current Service Status

All services are now running properly:

- ✅ PostgreSQL - Port 5432 (internal)
- ✅ Redis - Port 6379 (internal)
- ✅ Django API - Port 6161 (http://localhost:6161)
- ✅ Frontend - Port 4173 (http://localhost:4173)
- ✅ Celery Worker - Background tasks
- ✅ Celery Beat - Scheduled tasks

## Usage

### Start Services
```cmd
start-local.cmd
```

### Stop Services
```cmd
stop-local.cmd
```

### View Logs
```cmd
view-logs.cmd
```

### Check Status
```cmd
check-status.cmd
```

### Manual Commands
```cmd
cd god_bless_backend

# Start services
docker-compose up -d

# Stop services
docker-compose down

# View all logs
docker-compose logs -f

# View specific service logs
docker logs -f god_bless_app
docker logs -f god_bless_celery
docker logs -f god_bless_celery_beat
docker logs -f god_bless_postgres_db

# Check running containers
docker ps

# Restart a specific service
docker-compose restart god_bless_app
```

## Troubleshooting

### If services don't start
1. Check Docker Desktop is running
2. Run `docker-compose down` to clean up
3. Run `docker-compose up -d` to start fresh
4. Check logs with `docker-compose logs -f`

### If database connection fails
1. Wait 30 seconds for PostgreSQL to fully initialize
2. Check PostgreSQL logs: `docker logs god_bless_postgres_db`
3. Verify the container is running: `docker ps`

### If Celery tasks aren't running
1. Check Celery worker logs: `docker logs god_bless_celery`
2. Check Celery beat logs: `docker logs god_bless_celery_beat`
3. Verify Redis is running: `docker ps | findstr redis`

## Next Steps

1. Run migrations if needed:
   ```cmd
   docker exec god_bless_app python manage.py migrate
   ```

2. Create superuser:
   ```cmd
   docker exec -it god_bless_app python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

3. Access the application:
   - Frontend: http://localhost:4173
   - API: http://localhost:6161
   - Admin: http://localhost:6161/admin
