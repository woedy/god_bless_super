# Project Dashboard Double Header Fix

## Issue
The Project Dashboard page was showing double headers - one from the DefaultLayout and another from the ProjectDashboard component itself.

## Root Cause
The `ProjectDashboard` component was rendering its own `<Header>` component:

```tsx
<>
  <Header sidebarOpen={sidebarOpen} setSidebarOpen={setSidebarOpen} />
  <div className="mx-auto max-w-350 mt-5">
    {/* content */}
  </div>
</>
```

However, the route `/project/:projectId` is wrapped by `DefaultLayout` in App.tsx, which also renders a header. Even though `/project` is in the `hiddenOnRoutes` array (which should hide the DefaultLayout's header), the ProjectDashboard was still rendering its own header, causing duplication.

## Solution

Removed the redundant `<Header>` component from ProjectDashboard since the DefaultLayout handles the header rendering:

### Changes Made:

1. **Removed Header import**
```tsx
// Before
import Header from '../../components/Header';

// After
// (removed)
```

2. **Removed sidebarOpen state**
```tsx
// Before
const [sidebarOpen, setSidebarOpen] = useState(false);

// After
// (removed - not needed)
```

3. **Removed Header component from JSX**
```tsx
// Before
<>
  <Header sidebarOpen={sidebarOpen} setSidebarOpen={setSidebarOpen} />
  <div className="mx-auto max-w-350 mt-5">
    {/* content */}
  </div>
</>

// After
<div className="mx-auto max-w-350 mt-5">
  {/* content */}
</div>
```

4. **Simplified loading state**
```tsx
// Before
<>
  <Header sidebarOpen={sidebarOpen} setSidebarOpen={setSidebarOpen} />
  <div className="flex items-center justify-center h-screen">
    <div className="h-16 w-16 animate-spin..."></div>
  </div>
</>

// After
<div className="flex items-center justify-center h-screen">
  <div className="h-16 w-16 animate-spin..."></div>
</div>
```

## Benefits

1. **Single Header**: Only one header is displayed
2. **Consistent Layout**: Uses the same header as other pages
3. **Cleaner Code**: Removed unnecessary state and imports
4. **Better UX**: No visual duplication or confusion

## Testing

1. Navigate to any project dashboard (click on a project from All Projects)
2. Verify only one header is displayed at the top
3. Verify the sidebar toggle works correctly
4. Verify the breadcrumb is displayed properly

## Files Modified

- `god_bless_frontend/src/pages/Projects/ProjectDashboard.tsx`

## Related Components

The same pattern should be checked in other project-related pages:
- `ProjectTasks.tsx` - May have the same issue
- `AddProject.tsx` - Already has its own Header (intentional for standalone page)
- `AllProjects.tsx` - Already has its own Header (intentional for standalone page)

## Note

Pages like `AddProject` and `AllProjects` intentionally render their own headers because they're in the `hiddenOnRoutes` array and are designed to be standalone pages without the DefaultLayout's header. The ProjectDashboard should follow the standard layout pattern instead.
