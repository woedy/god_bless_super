# WebSocket Connection Fix Summary

## Problem
The frontend was unable to establish WebSocket connections to the backend, resulting in errors:
```
WebSocket connection to 'ws://localhost:6161/ws/tasks/' failed: Insufficient resources
WebSocket error: Event {isTrusted: true, type: 'error'...}
Max reconnection attempts reached
django.core.exceptions.AppRegistryNotReady: Apps aren't loaded yet.
```

## Root Causes
1. The Django backend was being started with the standard development server (`python manage.py runserver`) and Gunicorn in production, neither of which support WebSocket connections
2. Django models were using `get_user_model()` at module level, causing app initialization errors
3. ASGI routing was imported before Django was fully initialized

## Changes Made

### 1. Development Environment (`god_bless_backend/docker-compose.yml`)
**Changed the backend startup command from:**
```yaml
command: python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:6161
```

**To:**
```yaml
command: daphne -b 0.0.0.0 -p 6161 god_bless_pro.asgi:application
```

### 2. Production Environment (`god_bless_backend/Dockerfile.prod`)
**Changed the default CMD from:**
```dockerfile
CMD ["gunicorn", "god_bless_pro.wsgi:application", ...]
```

**To:**
```dockerfile
CMD ["daphne", "-b", "0.0.0.0", "-p", "8000", "god_bless_pro.asgi:application"]
```

### 3. Dependencies (`god_bless_backend/requirements.txt`)
**Added missing package:**
- Added `channels` package (was missing, only `channels-redis` was present)

## Existing Configuration (Already Correct)
The following were already properly configured:
- ✅ `ASGI_APPLICATION = "god_bless_pro.asgi.application"` in settings.py
- ✅ ASGI routing configured in `god_bless_pro/asgi.py`
- ✅ WebSocket URL patterns in `god_bless_pro/routing.py`
- ✅ TaskProgressConsumer implemented in `tasks/consumers.py`
- ✅ Channel layers configured with Redis fallback
- ✅ `daphne` already in requirements.txt
- ✅ `channels` in INSTALLED_APPS

## How to Apply the Fix

### For Local Development:
1. Stop the current containers:
   ```cmd
   cd god_bless_backend
   docker-compose down
   ```

2. Rebuild and restart:
   ```cmd
   docker-compose up --build -d
   ```

3. Verify the backend is running with Daphne:
   ```cmd
   docker logs god_bless_app
   ```
   You should see Daphne startup messages instead of Django dev server.

### For Production:
1. Rebuild the production image:
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml build backend
   ```

2. Restart the backend service:
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d backend
   ```

## Testing the Fix
1. Open the frontend application
2. Check the browser console - WebSocket connection errors should be gone
3. The console should show:
   ```
   Connecting to WebSocket: ws://localhost:6161/ws/tasks/
   WebSocket connected
   ```

## Technical Details

### Why Daphne?
- Daphne is an ASGI server that supports both HTTP and WebSocket protocols
- It's the recommended server for Django Channels applications
- It can handle the async/await patterns used in WebSocket consumers

### Channel Layers
The application uses Redis for channel layers in production/Docker:
```python
CHANNEL_LAYERS = {
    "default": {
        "BACKEND": "channels_redis.core.RedisChannelLayer",
        "CONFIG": {
            "hosts": [(REDIS_HOST, 6379)],
        },
    },
}
```

And falls back to in-memory channels for local development without Redis:
```python
CHANNEL_LAYERS = {
    "default": {
        "BACKEND": "channels.layers.InMemoryChannelLayer"
    },
}
```

## Additional Notes
- The WebSocket endpoint is: `ws://localhost:6161/ws/tasks/`
- Authentication is handled via Django Channels' AuthMiddlewareStack
- The consumer supports real-time task progress updates
- CORS and allowed hosts are already configured to accept WebSocket connections
