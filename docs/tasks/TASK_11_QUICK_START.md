- `/api/dashboard/system-health/` - System metrics
- `/api/dashboard/performance/` - Performance stats

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Dashboard Not Loading?

1. **Check backend is running:**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:6161/api/dashboard/analytics/?project_id=1
   ```

2. **Check authentication:**
   - Make sure you're logged in
   - Verify your token is valid

3. **Check browser console:**
   - Press F12 to open developer tools
   - Look for errors in the Console tab

### System Health Shows "Unavailable"?

Install psutil:
```bash
pip install psutil
```

```bash
cd god_bless_frontend
npm install apexcharts react-apexcharts
npm run dev
```
