# Task 15: Project Management Enhancement - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully enhanced the project management system with modern UI, task tracking, analytics, project-specific settings, and collaboration features.

## Backend Enhancements

### 1. Enhanced Models (`god_bless_backend/projects/models.py`)

- Added `priority` field with choices: low, medium, high, urgent
- Added project settings: `target_phone_count`, `target_sms_count`, `budget`
- Added collaboration: `collaborators` (ManyToMany relationship)
- Added date tracking: `start_date`, `due_date`, `completed_date`
- Added computed properties:
  - `task_stats`: Returns task statistics (total, completed, in_progress, pending, completion_rate)
  - `phone_stats`: Returns phone number statistics (total, valid, invalid)
  - `sms_stats`: Returns SMS statistics (total, sent, pending, failed)

#### New Models Created

**ProjectTask Model**

## Testing

Backend system check passed with no issues:
```bash
python manage.py check
System check identified no issues (0 silenced).
```

## Requirements Satisfied

## Next Steps

To use the enhanced project management system:

1. **Backend**: Already migrated and ready
2. **Frontend**: Routes configured and components created
3. **Access**: Navigate to `/all-projects` to see the enhanced project list
4. **Create**: Use the "Add Project" button to create projects with new fields
5. **Manage**: Click on any project to access the dashboard
6. **Tasks**: Use the task management interface to track project tasks
7. **Collaborate**: Add collaborators through the project settings

## Technical Notes
