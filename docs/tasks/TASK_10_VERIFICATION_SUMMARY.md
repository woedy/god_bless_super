## Integration Ready

The rotation system is ready to be integrated into:
- ✅ SMS campaign execution (Task 8)
- ✅ Email sending functionality
- ✅ Any service requiring proxy rotation
- ✅ Any service requiring SMTP rotation

### Example Integration
```python
# In SMS campaign task
from smtps.rotation_service import SMTPRotationService
from proxy_server.delivery_delay_service import DeliveryDelayService

smtp_service = SMTPRotationService(user)
delay_service = DeliveryDelayService(user)

for recipient in recipients:
    smtp = smtp_service.get_next_smtp()  # Get next SMTP
    delay_service.apply_delay()           # Apply delay
    send_email(smtp, recipient)           # Send email
    smtp.mark_success()                   # Track success
```
